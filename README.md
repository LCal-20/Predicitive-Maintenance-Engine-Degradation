- Pressure ratios (sensor_4/sensor_11)
- Efficiency indicators (sensor_8 √ó sensor_13)

**Engine-Level Statistics**
- Per-engine means and standard deviations
- Deviation from engine baseline
- Normalized cycle positions

### Model Architecture

**XGBoost Configuration**
- Gradient boosting with squared error loss
- Automated hyperparameter optimization
- 5-parameter grid search:
  - max_depth: [4, 5, 6]
  - learning_rate: [0.03, 0.05, 0.08, 0.1]

**Regularization**
- L1 regularization (alpha=0.1)
- L2 regularization (lambda=1.0)
- Feature subsampling to prevent overfitting

## üìà Evaluation Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Square Error
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error  
- **R¬≤**: Coefficient of determination
- **NASA Score**: Asymmetric scoring function penalizing late predictions more heavily


## üìä Visualizations

The system generates comprehensive visualizations:

1. **Feature Importance Plot**: Top 15 most predictive features
2. **Predictions vs Actual**: Scatter plot with perfect prediction line
3. **Residuals Analysis**: Error distribution and patterns
4. **Performance by RUL Range**: RMSE across different RUL intervals

## üî¨ Technical Details

### Data Preprocessing
- **RUL Capping**: Training RUL values capped at 125 cycles to reduce noise
- **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler normalization
- **Missing Value Handling**: Mean imputation
- **Infinite Value Treatment**: Replacement with column means

### Validation Strategy
- **Engine-Based Splitting**: 80/20 train/validation split at engine level
- **Prevents Data Leakage**: No engine appears in both training and validation
- **Realistic Evaluation**: Mimics real-world deployment scenario

### Feature Selection
Multi-criteria selection considering:
- **Correlation with RUL**: Pearson correlation coefficient
- **Feature Variability**: Coefficient of variation
- **Mutual Information**: Binned correlation approximation
- **Combined Score**: Weighted combination (40% correlation + 30% CV + 30% MI)

## üìã Output Files

The system generates several output files:
- `turbofan_results_FD00X.csv`: Detailed predictions per engine
- `feature_importance_FD00X.csv`: Feature importance rankings
- Interactive plots displayed during execution
